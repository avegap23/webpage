        <h2>Alvy</h2>
        <p>
            My actual nickname / Internet alias. You can refer to me as this.<br>
            It's a small variation of my old nickname that some of my closest friends liked to call me. On July 2024
            I ended up adopting it as my actual nickname since it sounded more in-line to my current personality (and
            other reasons listed down bellow).

        <h2>mancheganfur</h2>
        <p>
            Both my handle on most social media sites and my web domain. It's also a wildcard for when I'm making a new
            account and "Alvy" is already taken as nickname.<br>
            I was getting tired of having to use <span>Alvy_23, 4lvy, 4_lvy, etc</span> every time "Alvy" was taken for
            a handle. It also sucked having to remember which one was for which site. So I came up with the idea of
            having an universal and unique enough handle to use everywhere.<br>
            <span>I'm from Castilla-La Mancha, and I'm a furry. Yep, so much brainstorming for this one.</span>
