        <h2>Alvy</h2>
        <p>
            My actual nickname / Internet alias. You can refer to me as this.<br>
            It's a small variation of my old nickname that some of my closest friends liked to call me. On July 2024
            I ended up adopting it as my actual nickname since it sounded more in-line to my current personality (and
            other reasons listed down bellow).
        </p>

        <h2>mancheganfur</h2>
        <p>
            Both my handle on most social media sites and my web domain. It's also a wildcard for when I'm making a new
            account and "Alvy" is already taken as nickname.<br>
            I was getting tired of having to use <span>Alvy_23, 4lvy, 4_lvy, etc</span> every time "Alvy" was taken for
            a handle. It also sucked having to remember which one was for which site. So I came up with the idea of
            having an universal and unique enough handle to use everywhere.<br>
            <span>I'm from Castilla-La Mancha, and I'm a furry. Yep, so much brainstorming for this one.</span>
        </p>

        <h2>avegap</h2>
        <p>
            A handle like "mancheganfur", but more formal.<br>
            I use it whenever I register a new account for something serious like GitHub.
        </p>

        <h2>Alvax</h2>
        <p>
            My old nickname, which I've used for a pretty long time until relatively recently (as December 2025 when I'm
            writing this paragraph). That's why you may see some friends still refering to me by it.<br>
            I actually wanted to get rid of this alias for years, as it was very "Call of Duty lobby squeaker"-like
            (makes sense since I started using it when I was around 13). At the same time, it has been with me for so
            long that it would have been weird to start over again.<br>
            Then one day I tried to adopt that one variation some of my friends were calling me. It was perfect: I get
            rid of that awfull 'x' while not deviating too much from the original thing.<br><br>
            <span>(You may see me still using this name in some sites, that's most likely because they don't let you
                change it)</span>
